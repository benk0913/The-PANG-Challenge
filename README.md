# The-PANG-Challenge
 
"The Troublesome Dough" 

DEFAULT KEYS:
WASD + F for 		   PLAYER I
ARROW KEYS + ENTER for PLAYER II

Bonus Tasks:
1) MVC - As much as possible, unfortunately for this task, unity's common tools are designed as entities.
2) Three levels + campaign with increasing difficulty. No reasoning would be provided.
3) Custom visuals, but alas no unique shaders were designed (only imported), since there was no need for any of them.
4) Custom sounds / Music, to accompany the pixelated theme of the game.
5) Multiplayer 
6) Leaderboards, why not?

PS - The game is somewhat configurable, you may create additional characters / weapons / levels without changing the script,
** The Input keys are configurable as well.
** Some reasources are designed to be loaded on demand in an async manner, some are loaded as soon as they are demanded.
** Hotseat Multiplayer is only available for non-touch input devices.

I hope you'll find it entertaining!
